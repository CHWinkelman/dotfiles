* Dotfiles

Well, this is the current solution to my dotfiles. It's possible I should include my prelude dotfiles but those are sort of synced already. Maybe I should also include the powerline10k ones. I'm kinda sick of setting things I don't understand or care about later. I think I'm approaching a point of just flushing it all and starting over. That is certainly the reason for the boots (/short for bootstraps/) branch of my emacs init.

Anyway, let's boldly go down this shitshow of becoming a DevOps, if only to understand my own system.
